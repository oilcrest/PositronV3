## What and How to Contribute

### Did you run into a problem *building the original v3 according to https://github.com/KRALYN/PositronV3* that better instructions or guidance would have helped with?

First, check the Issue list.  If your problem is not already listed there, please raise an issue, *or*, if you can and would prefer to, fork and raise a pull request.  Make sure your issue has a clear title and description, and as much relevant information as possible.

### Have you identified a safety issue?

Check the issue list, and if you can't see the problem there, raise a GitHub Issue immediately.  The only reason I will change the design from the upstream is if a safety issue is discovered that the Positron team haven't yet released an update for.

### Do you have an improvement to the original design that would change the printer as-built?

Please bring it to the Kralyn discord.  The purpose of this repository is to aid construction of the PositronV3. This is an intentionally limited goal.

However, if there are low-impact improvements to the design which do not have a knock-on effect to the rest of the build that you think would be worth directing people towards as an alternative to the original, *do* raise an issue as above so that we can work out the best way to tell people that it exists.  Signposting improvements elsewhere is fine; changing the design as recorded upstream is not.

Thanks!
